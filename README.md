# Let's set the scene...

<div>
  I’m Olivia Batchelor, a <b>software engineering skills bootcamp graduate</b> 
  who is motivated to create programmes which <b>create a better picture</b> 
  for the user. 
  
<br>
  <br>
 👩‍🦱
  I am looking for a role which allows me to develop the skills I have learned and work collaboratively to achieve great results.

  💻
  Software Engineering, UX Research/Design and Data Analysis are my primary fields of interest. I have worked primarily with Python (including Kivy and Django) and have programmed a fair amount using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

  🎯
  My aim is to simplify users' lives, by designing and creating user-friendly programmes which remove informational clutter and feel good to use.
